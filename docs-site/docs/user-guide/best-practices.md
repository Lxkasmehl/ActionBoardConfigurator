# Best Practices

This guide provides essential best practices for using the WebAppConfigurator effectively. Following these guidelines will help you create efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly applications.

## Data Picker Best Practices

### 1. Query Optimization

- **Selective Property Selection**

  - Only select properties you actually need
  - Avoid selecting entire entities when specific properties suffice
  - Use navigation properties judiciously

- **Efficient Filtering**
  - Apply filters early in the data flow
  - Use specific filter conditions to reduce result sets
  - Combine related filters in a single condition group
  - Test filter performance with large datasets

### 2. Flow Structure

- **Flow Organization**

  - Keep flows as simple as possible
  - Use meaningful names for flows
  - Document complex flows with comments
  - Break down complex flows into smaller, reusable components

- **Entity Section Management**
  - Minimize the number of entity sections
  - Use clear connections between sections
  - Validate data flow before using in production
  - Test all possible data scenarios

## UI Builder Best Practices

### 1. Component Usage

- **Component Selection**

  - Choose appropriate components for your data type
  - Use headings for hierarchy and structure
  - Implement tables for structured data
  - Use charts for data visualization
  - Keep the interface clean and uncluttered

- **Component Configuration**
  - Configure components before grouping
  - Set meaningful labels and titles
  - Use consistent styling across components
  - Implement proper spacing and alignment

### 2. Group Management

- **Component Grouping**

  - Group related components logically
  - Keep groups focused and cohesive
  - Use consistent naming conventions
  - Document group purposes and relationships

- **Data Flow in Groups**
  - Ensure proper data flow between components
  - Validate group data connections
  - Test group interactions thoroughly
  - Maintain data consistency across components

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Data Loading

- **Query Optimization**

  - Minimize API calls
  - Use efficient filter combinations
  - Implement proper pagination
  - Cache frequently used data

- **Component Loading**
  - Load data only when needed
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Use lazy loading for large datasets
  - Optimize initial page load

### 2. User Experience

- **Interface Design**
