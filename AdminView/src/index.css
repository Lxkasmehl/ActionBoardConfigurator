/* WORKAROUND: This !important inset style is required for proper positioning of MUI Autocomplete
   listboxes when the app runs in production within SuccessFactors. However, this causes positioning
   issues in the development environment where the dropdowns are not properly visible for testing.
   The test suite uses a workaround by typing only the first 4 characters of option names to
   trigger autocomplete functionality despite the positioning problems. This solution is not perfect
   and similar positioning issues are already appearing in production with other autocomplete
   components, indicating that this approach may need to be redesigned in the future. */
